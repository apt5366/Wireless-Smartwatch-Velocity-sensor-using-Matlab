# Wireless-Smartwatch-Velocity-sensor-using-Matlabsenser-

•	Designed a velocity sensor using wireless signals to detect hand motion based on Doppler shifts observed at a smartwatch, utilizing data from multiple access points communicating with the smartwatch.
•	Utilized pure sine wave transmissions from access points at a carrier frequency of 5.800 GHz without modulation.
•	Received 5-second long downconverted and downsampled baseband signals from each access point.
•	Calculated Doppler shifts relative to each access point based on received signals.
•	Leveraged Doppler shift information to compute the 3D velocity of hand motion.
•	Developed a velocity sensor capable of accurately determining hand motion based on wireless signal Doppler shifts.
•	Processed input data containing 3D locations of access points and the smartwatch user, as well as baseband signals from each access point.
•	Produced output indicating the 3D velocity of the user's hand motion.
